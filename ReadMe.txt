	A git implementation in just C++
========================================================================

This is just a personal thing of mine.
I'd like it if there was a git implementation in pure c++, just because
I like this language.
Since there isn't one, I just started my own.
Ofcource I know already this doesnt get finished at all, but hey
I need to do something with my spare time.
